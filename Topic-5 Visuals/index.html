    <h1>What is Flowers?</h1>
    <p>
        A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants
        of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by
        providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and
        eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of
        sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
